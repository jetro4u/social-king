Social King provides Social Network Functionality, "the Service", to merchants who use Shopify to power their stores. This Privacy Policy describes how personal information is collected, used, and shared when you install or use the App in connection with your Shopify-supported store.

In General, any data collected by Social King is specifically for the purpose of:

Adding value to our customers
Optimizing and improving the App for Store Admins and their Shoppers


Shop Data

When a new Shopify Store installs the app, we save the Store URL. In addition, the Store Admin has the option to customize their Social Network experience by adding:

Custom Header Image
Custom Icon
Custom CSS Styling


Shopper Data

We save the Shopper Name & Email when a Shopper accesses the Shopper Admin area for the first time.

This can be when a shopper:

Creates their First Post
Creates their First Comment
Uploads their Profile Picture
Edits their Store Favorites and Bio
The purpose of saving Shopper Data is:

Show the Shopper Name and Profile Photo alongside the content they create
In future iterations, Store Admins will be able to send email notifications to shoppers in order to notify Shoppers that their content has been approved.


Product Data

When a Store Admin chooses products to promote alongside a post, we save the relevant Product Data, including:

Product Image
Product Title
Product URL
Product Variants


Usage Metrics (w/ Google Analytics)

When a new Shopify store creates an account, we generate a new Google Analytics Property on your behalf, and send usage metrics to that property.

The purpose of this usage collection is:

a) to improve the product for future iterations by providing metrics to store owners

b) studying popular features

c) measuring engagement of shoppers

d) counting the amount of clicks on products promoted within the user-generated content

e) Measure Click-Through Rate (CTR) on Promoted Products within User-Generated Posts (i.e. what percentage of users that read a given post clicked unto a related product)
